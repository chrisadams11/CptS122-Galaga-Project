Hey guys! I just created this repository, and I've got SFML now but I haven't started building the game yet.

I'll try to get you all added on here tomorrow so we can start work.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING KABLOOEY:

Navigate through the folders to a folder called "WindowsGame1"

Enter both "WindowsGame1" folders, and then open the 'publish' folder

Run "setup.exe", this will install the game on your computer

It should launch automatically after installing, but it will also be in your programs.
