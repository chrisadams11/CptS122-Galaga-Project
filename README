Hey guys! I just created this repository, and I've got SFML now but I haven't started building the game yet.

I'll try to get you all added on here tomorrow so we can start work.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING KABLOOEY:

Navigate through the folders to a folder called "WindowsGame1"

Enter both "WindowsGame1" folders, and then open the 'bin' folder

Open 'x86', then Release

Inside, you should see a .exe with a 360 controller as the icon. Double click to run!
